   <h1>Etherea – Thesis Project</h1>
    <p><strong>Period:</strong> September 2024 – April 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Unity, Python, Tobii Eye Tracker 5, Empatica Embrace Plus</p>


    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>Designing a 3D open‑world video game controlled via eye‑tracking, with an accessibility‑focused design for users with severe disabilities. 
    Assessing the gameplay experience through physiological parameters (EDA) and the Game Experience Questionnaire. 
    The goal was to demonstrate technical feasibility and measure the player’s response to real‑time events.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The game uses mouse emulation via eye‑tracker and an environmental interaction system based on a wink or dwell time. 
      The test was divided into three phases: tutorial, free exploration with puzzles (activation, sorting, placement), and a boss fight. 
      Every game element can be activated with elemental powers selectable through a UI placed at the bottom of the screen to minimize intrusiveness.</p>

    <p>Interaction is simplified with visual feedback (icons, loading bar, lighting effects) and menus are designed for exclusive gaze use. 
      The environment is enriched with visual cues (obelisks) to guide the player toward challenges, and by merely shifting gaze 
      one can switch between interaction mode and movement mode, as well as toggle the camera view between third‑person and first‑person.</p>

    <h2>Analysis and Results</h2>
    <p>Tests were conducted in three sessions. 
      EDA data show decreasing trends, suggesting a relaxing effect of the game. 
      Physiological impulses do not always coincide with specific interaction events, indicating that EDA alone is not sufficient to assess engagement, 
      but is useful in combination with other parameters, especially in the case of certain pathologies. 
      The Game Experience Questionnaire revealed overall positive feedback, but a low perceived challenge.</p>
